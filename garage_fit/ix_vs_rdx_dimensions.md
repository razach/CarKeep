# 2024 BMW iX vs. 2019 Acura RDX: Garage Fit Comparison

This document compares the exterior dimensions of the 2024 BMW iX and the 2019 Acura RDX to assess if the iX will fit in a garage that currently accommodates the RDX.

## Dimensional Comparison

| Dimension | 2024 BMW iX | 2019 Acura RDX | Difference (iX vs. RDX) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Length** | 195.0 inches | 186.8 inches | +8.2 inches |
| **Width (without mirrors)** | 77.4 inches | 74.8 inches | +2.6 inches |
| **Width (with mirrors)** | 87.8 inches | 91.5 inches | -3.7 inches |
| **Height** | 66.8 inches | 65.7 inches | +1.1 inches |

## Key Considerations

*   **Length:** The BMW iX is **8.2 inches longer** than the Acura RDX. With only 6 inches of lengthwise clearance to spare, this will be a very tight fit and may require careful parking.

*   **Width:** The iX is **2.6 inches wider** than the RDX (measuring body to body, without mirrors). However, with mirrors extended, the iX is actually **3.7 inches narrower** than the RDX. You mentioned you have about an inch of clearance with the RDX's mirrors unfolded, which suggests the garage opening is narrow.

## BMW iX Mirror Folding Feature

The 2024 BMW iX comes standard with power-folding side mirrors. This feature is critical for your situation.

*   **Manual Folding:** You can fold the mirrors on demand by pressing a button on the driver's side door panel. This is ideal for navigating the tight entry into your garage.
*   **Automatic Folding:** The mirrors can be programmed to fold automatically when the vehicle is locked and unfold when unlocked.

Given the narrow clearance, the ability to fold the mirrors on approach will be essential. The iX's width without mirrors (77.4 inches) is the most important measurement for garage entry.
