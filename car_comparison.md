# Car Ownership Analysis: RDX vs. BMW iX vs. Polestar 3
 
 ## Executive Summary & Recommendation
 
 After rigorous review—including specific logic for **lease extensions** and **lost investment income on down payments**—the conclusion remains solid: **Keeping the Acura RDX is the financial winner.**
 
 However, the gap between the two new cars has narrowed significantly. The Polestar 3 is now only marginally more expensive than the BMW iX purchase over 3 years. **The BMW iX Lease is by far the most expensive option.**
 
 **3-Year Total Cost Difference (vs. Keeping RDX):**
 *   **Keep Acura RDX:** Baseline ($0)
 *   **Buy BMW iX (CPO):** **+$31,622**
 *   **Lease Polestar 3:** **+$33,275**
 *   **Lease BMW iX (New):** **+$54,455**
 
 **Recommendation:**
 1.  **Financial Choice:** Keep the RDX. You save over **$30,000**.
 2.  **New Car Choice:** The **BMW iX Purchase (CPO)** maximizes value by building equity. The **Polestar 3 Lease** is a strong competitive alternative due to its low interest rate (MF).
 3.  **Avoid:** The **BMW iX Lease**. It provides no equity, has high cash flow ($621/mo + $6k down), and results in a **$54k** total 3-year cost difference.

 ### Analysis of Options
 
 #### 1. Keep Acura RDX (Winner)
 *   **Total Cost:** Baseline.
 *   **Pros:** Cheapest option, maximizing wealth.
 *   **Cons:** Older tech, ICE vehicle maintenance increases.
 
 #### 2. Buy BMW iX CPO (Best New Option)
 *   **Total Cost:** +$31,622
 *   **Pros:** You own a premium EV. Despite high payments, the car retains significant value ($22k+) at year 3, which acts as a "savings account" compared to leasing.
 *   **Cons:** High interest rate (6.19%) hurts the bottom line.
 
 #### 3. Lease Polestar 3 (Competitive)
 *   **Total Cost:** +$33,275
 *   **Pros:** Lowest monthly payment ($312). Incredible interest rate (~1%).
 *   **Cons:** You walk away with nothing. The "effective cost" is higher than it looks because you have no asset at the end.
 
 #### 4. Lease BMW iX New (Most Expensive)
 *   **Total Cost:** +$54,455
 *   **Pros:** Brand new car.
 *   **Cons:** **Financial destruction.** You pay ~$29k in lease payments + ~$6k upfront, plus you pay high property tax on an $81k car, and at the end of 3 years you return the keys and have $0 equity. You effectively pay **$1,500/month** (amortized) to drive this car.
