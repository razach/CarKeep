# Car Ownership Analysis: RDX vs. BMW iX vs. Polestar 3

## Executive Summary & Recommendation

After rigorous review—including specific logic for **lease extensions** and **lost investment income on down payments**—the conclusion remains solid: **Keeping the Acura RDX is the financial winner vs having to pay for a new car.**

However, the gap between the two new cars has narrowed significantly. The Polestar 3 is now only marginally more expensive than the BMW iX over 3 years.

**3-Year Total Cost Difference (vs. Keeping RDX):**
*   **Keep Acura RDX:** Baseline ($0)

2.  **New Car Choice:** The **BMW iX** is the better financial option by ~$1,600. It builds nearly $22,000 in equity, whereas the Polestar lease leaves you with nothing but your returned deposit.

### Addressing Key Questions
**"Wouldn't leasing a new Polestar mean paying another downpayment?"**
*   **Yes.** Our model accounts for this. The Polestar lease is only 27 months. For the remaining 9 months of the 3-year plan, we simulated an "effective monthly cost" of **~$516/mo**.
*   This figure comes from amortizing the initial down payment ($5,530) and monthly payments ($312) over the 27-month term.
*   This accurately represents the cost intensity of "re-leasing" a similar vehicle without needing to explicitly simulate a complex second transaction.

**"Am I not paying interest on the lease?"**
*   **Yes, but it's very low.** The "Money Factor" is 0.00045, which is roughly **1.08% APR**. This is incredibly cheap money compared to the BMW loan (6.19% APR). That's why the "Interest" row for Polestar is only +$733 vs +$5,187 for BMW.
